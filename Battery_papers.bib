  Abstract                 = {The estimation of temperature inside a battery cell requires accurate information about the cooling conditions even when the battery surface temperature is measured. This paper presents a model-based approach for estimating temperature distribution inside a cylindrical battery under unknown convective cooling conditions. A reduced-order thermal model using a polynomial approximation of the temperature profile inside the battery is used. A dual Kalman filter (DKF), a combination of a Kalman filter and an extended Kalman filter, is then applied for the identification of the convection coefficient and the estimation of the battery core temperature. The thermal properties are modeled by volume averaged lumped-values under the assumption of a homogeneous and isotropic volume. The model is parameterized and validated using experimental data from a 2.3 Ah 26,650 lithium-iron-phosphate battery cell with a forced-air convective cooling during hybrid electric vehicle drive cycles. Experimental results show that the proposed DKF-based estimation method can provide an accurate prediction of the core temperature under unknown cooling conditions by measuring battery current and voltage along with surface and ambient temperatures.},

  Abstract                 = {Lithium ion batteries should always be prevented from overheating and, hence, thermal monitoring is indispensable. Since only the surface temperature of the battery can be measured, a thermal model is needed to estimate the core temperature of the battery, which can be higher and more critical. In this paper, an online parameter identification scheme is designed for a cylindrical lithium ion battery. An adaptive observer of the core temperature is then designed based on the online parameterization methodology and the surface temperature measurement. A battery thermal model with constant internal resistance is explored first. The identification algorithm and the adaptive observer is validated with experiments on a 2.3Ah 26650 lithium iron phosphate/graphite battery. The methodology is later extended to address temperature-dependent internal resistance with nonuniform forgetting factors. The ability of the methodology to track the long-term variation of the internal resistance is beneficial for battery health monitoring.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Combining several existing lumped-parameter models, this paper presents an electro-thermal model for cylindrical batteries. The model consists of two sub-models, an equivalent-circuit electrical model and a two-state thermal model which are coupled through heat generation and temperature dependence of the electrical parameters. The computationally efficient 5-state model captures the state of charge (SOC), terminal voltage, surface temperature and the often neglected core temperature of a battery for wide range of operating conditions. The proposed parameterization scheme allows separate identification of the electric and thermal sub-models, greatly reducing the complexity of the parameterization process. The methodology is applied to a LiFePO4/graphite battery. Comparison with the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data clarifies the frequency range of the model fidelity. The model is further validated with two drive-cycle tests, covering \{SOC\} range 25%â€“100%, temperature 5Â Â°Câ€“38Â Â°C, and maximum C-rate of 22C.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Swelling of a commercial 5Â Ah lithium-ion cell with a nickel/manganese/cobalt-oxide cathode is investigated as a function of the charge state and the charge/discharge rate. In combination with sensitive displacement measurements, knowledge of the electrode configuration within this prismatic cell's interior allows macroscopic deformations of the casing to be correlated to electrochemical and mechanical transformations in individual anode/separator/cathode layers. Thermal expansion and interior charge state are both found to cause significant swelling. At low rates, where thermal expansion is negligible, the electrode sandwich dilates by as much as 1.5% as the charge state swings from 0% to 100% because of lithium-ion intercalation. At high rates a comparably large residual swelling was observed at the end of discharge. Thermal expansion caused by joule heating at high discharge rate results in battery swelling. The changes in displacement with respect to capacity at low rate correlate well with the potential changes known to accompany phase transitions in the electrode materials. Although the potential response changes minimally with the C-rate, the extent of swelling varies significantly, suggesting that measurements of swelling may provide a sensitive gauge for characterizing dynamic operating states.},

  Abstract                 = {The expansion of battery material during lithium intercalation is a concern for the cycle life and performance of lithium ion batteries. In this paper, electrode expansion is quantified from in situ neutron images taken during cycling of pouch cells with lithium iron phosphate positive and graphite negative electrodes. Apart from confirming the overall expansion as a function of state of charge and the correlation with graphite transitions that have been observed in previous dilatometer experiments we show the spatial distribution of the expansion along the individual electrodes of the pouch cell. The experiments were performed on two cells with different electrode areas during low and high c-rate operation. The measurements show how charging straightened the cell layers that were slightly curved by handling of the pouch cell during setup of the experiment. Subsequent high charging rate, that exceeded the suggested operating voltage limits, was shown to have a strong influence on the observed expansion. Specifically, during high-rate cycling, the battery showed a much larger and irreversible expansion of around 1.5% which was correlated with a 4% loss in capacity over 21 cycles.},

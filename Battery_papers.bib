abstract = {This paper describes a simple isothermal two-phase flow dynamic model that predicts the experimentally observed temporal behavior of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell stack. This model is intended for use in embedded real time control where computational simplicity is of critical importance. A reproducible methodology is presented to experimentally identify six (6) tunable physical parameters based on the estimation of the cell voltage, the water vapor transport through the membrane and the accumulation of liquid water in the gas channels. The model equations allow temporal calculation of the species concentrations across the gas diffusion layers, the vapor transport across the membrane, and the degree of flooding within the cell structure. The notion of apparent current density then relates this flooding phenomena to cell performance through a reduction in the cell active area as liquid water accumulates. Despite the oversimplification of many complex phenomena, this model provides a useful tool for predicting the resulting decay in cell voltage over time only after it has been tuned with experimental data. The calibrated model and tuning procedure is demonstrated with a 1.4 kW (24 cell, 300 cm2) stack, using pressure regulated pure hydrogen supplied to a dead-ended anode, under a range of operating conditions typical for multi-cell stacks. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Neutron imaging of a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) revealed distinct patterns of water fronts moving through the gas diffusion layers (GDL) and channels [1]. The PEMFC was operating with dead-ended, straight and almost vertically-oriented anode channels; hence the gravity driven accumulation of liquid water at the end of the channel caused flooding in an upward direction. In order to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of water patterns inside severely-flooded fuel cells, various distributed parameter models of the water transport through the membrane and GDLs to the cathode and anode channels have been developed by the authors and others. In this paper, a zero-dimensional moving front model is presented which captures the location of the water phase transition inside the GDL, instead of using the standard partial differential equation (PDE) approach for modeling liquid water in porous media which is numerically difficult to solve. This model uses three nonlinear states (the anode and cathode GDL front location and the membrane water content) and three inputs (the anode and cathode vapor concentration and the current density) to predict the slowly evolving front locations in both anode and cathode side GDLs during flooding and drying as well as the dynamic changes in membrane water content. The unit cell model is finally formulated with three hybrid modes and their transition laws. The hybrid-state model will be parameterized in the future using experimentally observed front evolutions. This parameterized unit cell model will be used to model the water accumulation along the channel in order to predict and avoid severe flooding conditions. ?? 2009 AACC.},

abstract = {In a PEMFC, feeding dry hydrogen into a dead-ended anode (DEA), reduces the overall system cost, weight and volume due to reduced need for a hydrogen-grade humidification and recirculation subsystems, but requires purging to remove the accumulated water and inert gas. Although the DEA method of operation might be undesirable due to its associated high spatial variability it provides a unique perspective on the evolution of the water accumulation in the anode. Sections of the channel nearest the inlets are significantly drier than those nearest the outlet as shown in the neutron imaging of a 53 cm2 PEMFC. This method allows in-situ visualization of distinct patterns, including water front propagation along the channels. In this paper we utilize neutron imaging of the liquid water distributions and a previously developed PDE model of liquid water flow in the GDL to (a) identify a range of numerical values for the immobile saturation limit, (b) propose a gravity-driven liquid flow in the channels, and (c) derive the two-phase GDL boundary conditions associated with the presence of liquid water in the channel.

abstract = {This paper presents a numerical calculation of the evolution of the spatially resolved solid concentration in the two electrodes of a lithium-ion cell. The microscopic solid concentration is driven by the macroscopic Butler–Volmer current density distribution, which is consequently driven by the applied current through the boundary conditions. The resulting, mostly causal, implementation of the algebraic differential equations that describe the battery electrochemical principles, even after assuming fixed electrolyte concentration, is of high order and complexity and is denoted as the full order model. The full order model is compared with the results in the works of Smith and Wang (2006, “Solid-State Diffusion Limitations on Pulse Operation of a Lithium-Ion Cell for Hybrid Electric Vehicles,” J. Power Sources, 161, pp. 628–639) and Wang (2007 “Control oriented 1D Electrochemical Model of Lithium Ion Battery,” Energy Convers. Manage., 48, pp. 2565–2578) and creates our baseline model, which will be further simplified for charge estimation. We then propose a low order extended Kalman filter for the estimation of the average-electrode charge similarly to the single-particle charge estimation in the work of White and Santhanagopalan (2006, “Online Estimation of the State of Charge of a Lithium Ion Cell,” J. Power Sources, 161, pp. 1346–1355) with the following two substantial enhancements. First, we estimate the average-electrode, or single-particle, solid-electrolyte surface concentration, called critical surface charge in addition to the more traditional bulk concentration called state of charge. Moreover, we avoid the weakly observable conditions associated with estimating both electrode concentrations by recognizing that the measured cell voltage depends on the difference, and not the absolute value, of the two electrode open circuit voltages. The estimation results of the reduced, single, averaged electrode model are compared with the full order model simulation.},

abstract = {We analyze the controllability and observability (C/O) of the liquid water distribution in the gas diffusion layer (GDL) of a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) using a one-dimensional channel-to-channel unit fuel cell model. This modeling domain is sufficient to illustrate the control objectives and analysis techniques but requires further development for stack level modeling. A comparison is made between first-principles-based numeric and reduced-order semi-analytic models with emphasis on the effects of model reduction on their analyses. The numeric model is a partial differential equation based model approximated by difference equations, including both channels and both GDLs of a PEMFC. The reduced model uses a semi-analytic solution method, which is a combination of analytic and numeric solutions, gaining physical intuition at lower computational cost. The C/O analysis is based on linearizations around three critical operating points. The results indicate that stabilizability of the anode liquid water states and, hence, management of anode water flooding is possible. If the channel water mass can be controlled to a constant value, then the GDL liquid distribution will be stable (McCain, 2007, "A Multi-Component Spatially-Distributed Model of Two-Phase Flow for Estimation and Control of Fuel Cell Water Dynamics," Proceedings of the 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, pp. 584-589). Further, it will be shown that if the channel liquid water mass can be brought to zero, controllability of the GDL liquid modes will be obtained. Additionally, this study will indicate the input(s) best suited to obtain this control objective and the output(s) required. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

abstract = {PEMFC operation with dead-ended anode has inherent transient behavior: the cell operates between purge cycles that replenish fuel and discharge accumulated gases, such as nitrogen and water vapor, and liquid water. During the operation when the anode exit is shut, gases that cross-over from the cathode accumulate and stratify in the anode channels above the liquid water when the gravity is acting in the flow direction. In this work, we present a transient two-dimensional along the channel model and simulations of the PEMFC operating with a dead-ended anode. The transport of gas species in flow channels and gas diffusion layers is modeled by Maxwell-Stefan equations. Flow in the channels is modeled by laminarized Navier-Stokes equations, where the inertial terms are dropped from the force balance, but the buoyancy effect due to the variation of the composition of gas mixture is included at the anode side. Flow in the gas diffusion layers is modeled by Darcy's Law. Permeation of nitrogen in the membrane is considered since it can accumulate in the anode as opposed to instant reaction of oxygen (hydrogen) at the anode (cathode) catalyst layer(s). The membrane is considered as a resistance (interface) to transport of water vapor and nitrogen. Ohm's Law is used to model the transport of charged particles, i.e. electrons in the electrodes and flow plates and protons in the membrane. A finite-element representation of the governing equations in the 2D PEMFC geometry is solved using a commercial multiphysics software, COMSOL. The imposed boundary conditions are chosen to match the experimental conditions. According to model results the reversible voltage degradation between purge cycles is mostly caused by nitrogen accumulation in the anode that leads to partial fuel starvation in the cell. {\textcopyright} 2010 by ASME.},

on the electrode carbon corrosion of the Proton Exchange Membrane
(PEM) fuel cell. A reduced order isothermal model is developed focusing
on the species concentration along the channel and associated membrane
phase potential. This model explains, and can be used to quantify,
the carbon corrosion behavior during DEA operation of a PEM fuel
cell. The presence of oxygen in the anode channel, although normally
less than 5{\%} in molar fraction, creates a H2/O2 front as N2 and water
accumulate at the end of the channel and hydrogen is depleted along
the channel. The presence of oxygen in the anode channel also results
in a gradual drop of the membrane phase potential, promoting carbon
corrosion in the cathode. The corrosion rate is driven by the local
species concentration in the anode, which varies in space and time.
In a co-flow configuration, the large spatio-temporal patterns of
hydrogen starvation in the end of the anode channel induce the highest
carbon corrosion, which, in turn, is shown to be moderated by the
decreasing terminal voltage during galvanostatic operation. Although
not fully calibrated, the model shows good agreement with preliminary
in situ observations.},

anode (DEA) operation of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell. A
reduced order model is developed focusing on the species molar fraction

a partial region in the anode, and the remaining region is deactivated
by the accumulation of water and nitrogen. Simulation results are
analysed to study the influences of certain controllable inputs and
system parameters on the nitrogen front location and steady-state

In this work, we investigate the electrode and membrane degradations of one 50 cm 2 active area fuel cell under DEA operation using a combination of post- mortem evaluation and in-situ performance evaluation protocol. We experimentally identify multiple degradation patterns using a cell which we have previously modeled and experimentally veri- fied the spatio-temporal patterns associated with the anode water flooding and nitrogen blanketing. The change in cell voltage and internal resistance during operation and ex situ Scanning Elec- tron Microscope (SEM) images of aged electrode/membrane are analysed to determine and characterize the degradation of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). Chemical degradations including carbon corrosion in the catalyst layer and membrane decomposition are found after operating the cell with a DEA. Mechanical degradations including membrane delamination are also observed. Unique features of DEA operation including fuel starvation/nitrogen blanketing in the anode and uneven local wa- ter/current distribution, are considered as culprits for degrada- tion. {\textcopyright} 2011 by ASME.},

abstract = {The operation of PEM fuel cells (PEMFC) with dead-ended anode (DEA) leads to severe voltage transients due to accumulation of nitrogen, water vapor and liquid water in the anode channels and the gas diffusion layer (GDL). Accumulation of nitrogen causes a large voltage transient with a characteristic profile whereas the amount of water vapor in the anode is limited by the saturation pressure, and the liquid water takes up very small volume at the bottom of the anode channels in the case of downward orientation of the gravity. Here, we present a transient 1D along-the-channel model of PEMFCs operating with periodically-purged DEA channels. In the model, transport of species is modeled by the Maxwell-Stefan equations coupled with constraint equations for the cell voltage. A simple resistance model is used for the membrane to express the permeance of nitrogen and transport of water through the membrane. The model results agree very well with experimental results for the voltage transients of the PEMFC operating with DEA. In order to emphasize the effect of nitrogen accumulation in the anode, we present experimentally obtained cell voltage measurements during DEA transients, when the cathode is supplied with pure oxygen. In the absence of nitrogen in the cathode, voltage remained almost constant throughout the transient. Then, the model is used to determine the effect of oxygen-to-nitrogen feed ratio in the cathode on the voltage transient behavior for different load currents. Lastly, the model is used to show the effect of the small amount of leak from the anode exit on the voltage transient; even for leak rates as low as less than 10 ml/h, nitrogen accumulation in the anode channels is alleviated and the cell voltage remained almost constant throughout the transient. {\textcopyright} 2011 by ASME.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the optimization of the purge cycle for dead-ended
anode (DEA) operation of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell.
Controling the purge interval at given operating conditions can optimize
the fuel cell efficiency and hydrogen loss during the purge. For
this optimization, a model capturing the liquid water and nitrogen
accumulation in the anode and the purge flow behavior is presented.
A target range of purge interval is then defined based on the minimal
purge time that removes the plug of liquid and nitrogen in the channel
end and the maximum purge interval beyond which hydrogen is wasted
since hydrogen molar fraction all along the channel has been restored
to one. If the purge is sufficiently long that all of the accumulated
water and nitrogen are removed then the power output in the subsequent
cycle (galvanostatic operation) would be highest, compared with incomplete
purges which do not fully restore hydrogen concentration in the anode.
Such purge schedule, however, is associated with certain amount of
hydrogen loss. Therefore, there is a trade-off between hydrogen loss
and power output, and a corresponding purge interval that produces
the largest efficiency. The optimum purge intervals for different
cycle durations are identified. The calculated DEA efficiencies are
compared with flow-through (FT) operation. The analysis and model-based
optimization methodology presented in this paper can be used for
optimizing DEA operation of PEMFC with minimum experimentation and
development time.},

abstract = {Dead-Ended Anode (DEA) operation of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) yields a system with lower complexity and the potential to reduce system cost as fewer external components are required. Optimization of the purge interval and cycle duration, for a given operating power, can increase the fuel cell efficiency which depends on three interrelated objectives, namely, the hydrogen loss during the purge, the average voltage output between the purges, and the voltage decrease due to the carbon corrosion caused by hydrogen starvation over the lifetime of the DEA operation. In advancing past results, this paper shows how the purge cycle can be optimized for better efficiency in DEA operation by considering the impact of carbon corrosion. For this optimization, a model capturing the liquid water and nitrogen accumulation in the anode is needed to accurately describe the evolution of corrosion rate and the amount of hydrogen wasted during the purge. The optimization process is first defining a target range of purge intervals based on the physical constraints of the actuator and the model-based prediction of the species concentration distributions. The search of optima is performed then by scanning the target domain to quantify the trade-off between wasted hydrogen and reducing the corrosion rate over a long time horizon.

abstract = {To improve the performance and durability of a dead-ended anode (DEA) fuel cell, it is important to understand and characterize the degradation associated with the DEA operation. To this end, the multiple degradation phenomena in DEA operation were investigated via systematic experiments. Three lifetime degradation tests were conducted with different cell temperatures and cathode relative humidities, during which the temporal evolutions of cell voltage and high frequency resistance (HFR) were recorded. When the cathode supply was fully humidified and the cell temperature was mild, the cathode carbon corrosion was the predominant degradation observed from scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) of postmortem samples. The catalyst layer and membrane thickness were measured at multiple locations across the cell active area in order to map the degradation patterns. These observations confirm a strong correlation between the cathode carbon corrosion and the anode fuel starvation occurring near the cell outlet. When the cathode supply RH reduced to 50{\%}, membrane pin-hole failures terminated the degradation test. Postmortem analysis showed membrane cracks and delamination in the inlet region where membrane water content was the lowest. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

This article presents a hardware-in-the-loop validation of this strategy, with a real engine and battery integrated into a diesel hybrid electric vehicle simulation, thereby allowing for a realistic evaluation of fuel economy, soot emissions, and battery life. Considering an aggressive drive cycle and a state-of-charge regulation strategy as a benchmark, the frequency-based strategy yields 5.9{\%} increase in fuel economy, 62.7{\%} decrease in soot emissions, and 23{\%} reduction in effective Amp-hours processed, which should yield an increase in battery life. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

To facilitate the thermal management of a battery pack, a model-based observer could be designed to estimate the temperature distribution across the pack. Nevertheless, cost target in industry practice drives the number of temperature sensors in a pack to a number that is not sufficient to yield observability of all the temperature states. This paper focuses on formulating the observer design and sensor deployment strategy that could achieve the optimal observer performance under the frugal sensor allocation. The considered observer performance is the estimation errors induced by model and sensor uncertainty. The observer aims at minimizing the worst-case estimation errors under bounded model and sensor uncertainty.},

abstract = {Combining several existing lumped-parameter models, this paper presents an electro-thermal model for cylindrical batteries. The model consists of two sub-models, an equivalent-circuit electrical model and a two-state thermal model which are coupled through heat generation and temperature dependence of the electrical parameters. The computationally efficient 5-state model captures the state of charge (SOC), terminal voltage, surface temperature and the often neglected core temperature of a battery for wide range of operating conditions. The proposed parameterization scheme allows separate identification of the electric and thermal sub-models, greatly reducing the complexity of the parameterization process. The methodology is applied to a LiFePO4/graphite battery. Comparison with the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data clarifies the frequency range of the model fidelity. The model is further validated with two drive-cycle tests, covering SOC range 25{\%}-100{\%}, temperature 5 °C-38 °C, and maximum C-rate of 22C. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A phenomenological model of the bulk force exerted by a lithium ion cell during various charge, discharge, and temperature operating conditions is developed. The measured and modeled force resembles the carbon expansion behavior associated with the phase changes during intercalation, as there are ranges of state of charge (SOC) with a gradual force increase and ranges of SOC with very small change in force. The model includes the influence of temperature on the observed force capturing the underlying thermal expansion phenomena. Moreover the model is capable of describing the changes in force during thermal transients, when internal battery heating due to high C-rates or rapid changes in the ambient temperature, which create a mismatch in the temperature of the cell and the holding fixture. It is finally shown that the bulk force model can be very useful for a more accurate and robust SOC estimation based on fusing information from voltage and force (or pressure) measurements.},

abstract = {Swelling of a commercial 5 Ah lithium-ion cell with a nickel/manganese/ cobalt-oxide cathode is investigated as a function of the charge state and the charge/discharge rate. In combination with sensitive displacement measurements, knowledge of the electrode configuration within this prismatic cell's interior allows macroscopic deformations of the casing to be correlated to electrochemical and mechanical transformations in individual anode/separator/cathode layers. Thermal expansion and interior charge state are both found to cause significant swelling. At low rates, where thermal expansion is negligible, the electrode sandwich dilates by as much as 1.5{\%} as the charge state swings from 0{\%} to 100{\%} because of lithium-ion intercalation. At high rates a comparably large residual swelling was observed at the end of discharge. Thermal expansion caused by joule heating at high discharge rate results in battery swelling. The changes in displacement with respect to capacity at low rate correlate well with the potential changes known to accompany phase transitions in the electrode materials. Although the potential response changes minimally with the C-rate, the extent of swelling varies significantly, suggesting that measurements of swelling may provide a sensitive gauge for characterizing dynamic operating states. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed two state equivalent electric circuit model mimics the terminal voltage dynamics and could be used to evaluate the power capability and efficiency of the cell. The electric model parameters are estimated by pulse-relaxation tests for sub-zero temperatures as low as -40 °C. The two state thermal model provides a tool to estimate the surface and core temperature dynamics.

Parameterization of the distributed resistances in the equivalent circuit model is demonstrated using lumped parameter measurements, and are a function of local temperature. The model is parameterized and validated with data collected from a 3-cell fixture which replicates pack cooling conditions. Pulsing current experiments are used for validation over a wide range of operating conditions (ambient temperature, state of charge, current amplitude and pulse width).

The downsized pack design with shifted SOC window is evaluated in a light- duty hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) where the power demanded by the battery pack is specified prior to downsizing. A calibrated electro-thermal model and a semi-empirical capacity fade model are used to capture voltage, state-of-charge, temperature and capacity loss of the downsized battery. The capacity fade model is developed based on a novel set of experiments designed to clarify the influence of nominal operating SOC on battery degradation. The parametric study shows that the pack size could be reduced from 76 to 64 cells while shifting nominal operating SOC from 50{\%} to 35{\%} without experiencing battery power denials.

abstract = {Compact battery pack design and cooling requirements present significant challenges for the placement of temperature sensors. Typically, temperature sensors are located near the edge of the battery, and away from the hottest regions, which leads to slower response times and increased errors in the prediction of interior cell temperature. New sensor technology allows for sensor placement between cells to improve sensor performance. With the ability to place sensors anywhere on the exterior of the cell, an observability analysis is necessary to determine the optimal locations for these sensors. The analysis is performed using a spatial discretization of a validated electrothermal model. This model describes a 5 Ah Li-ion cell harvested from a Ford C-max 2013 pack. Given that the spatial discretization of the heat partial differential equation (PDE) governing the system results in singular values that are very small (numerically zero), two methods are presented in this paper to quantify observability and address the issue of optimal sensor placement. The optimal sensor placement between cells yields a 240{\%} improvement (for 3 sensors on the surface) and 15{\%} improvement (for one sensor on the surface) in observability over existing sensor placement near the top edge of the cell. The pack geometry and airflow conditions impact sensor placement. It is preferable to place the sensors towards the outlet side of the airflow as opposed to the inlet side, resulting in a 13{\%} improvement in observability.},

A propane powered 200W solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) developed by Adaptive Materials Inc. (AMI) is an example of one such system. This fuel cell should be operated at full power to obtain maximum system efficiency or turned off to conserve fuel. This operating strategy with quantized power levels (either on or off) must be paired with a battery to provide the energy to re-start the fuel cell and power the vehicle during turndown periods. We compare the hybridized SOFC system to one with an open cathode Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cell paired with a battery that allows the PEM FC to load-follow or load-level. The application to military tracked robots for two distinct profiles (realistic driving and scouting) is considered as an example and highlights the need for concurrent power source sizing and power splitting.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of estimating SOC-imbalance between two battery cells connected in series. Particularly, the effectiveness of using force measurements for the SOC-imbalance detection against pack/total voltage measurements is studied. SOC imbalance estimation during charging using pack voltage measurement was previously demonstrated for the LiFePO4/graphite battery chemistry. However, the Li-ion battery with LiNiMnCoO2/graphite, which is of great interest in a hybrid electric vehicle application, exhibits an almost linear relation between SOC and voltage when battery SOC is greater than 15{\%}. This characteristic makes SOC imbalance estimation using pack voltage challenging. The use of other novel measurands, related to volumetric change of the electrode materials during battery operations, make the problem feasible. To estimate SOCs of two batteries connected in series, a Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) technique is applied and three different measurement sets are considered: (1) total voltage, (2) force, and (3) both voltage and force. Simulations results show that, for the batteries of interest, the inclusion of force measurements significantly improves the estimation of SOC-imbalance.},

abstract = {This paper addresses scheduling of quantized power levels (including part load operation and startup/shutdown periods) for a propane powered solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) hybridized with a lithium-ion battery for a tracked mobile robot. The military requires silent operation and long duration missions, which cannot be met by batteries alone due to low energy density or with combustion engines due to noise. To meet this need we consider an SOFC operated at a few discrete power levels where maximum system efficiency can be achieved. The fuel efficiency decreases during transients and resulting thermal gradients lead to stress and degradation of the stack; therefore switching power levels should be minimized. Excess generated energy is used to charge the battery, but when it's fully charged the SOFC should be turned off to conserve fuel. However, startup and shutdown phases consume both battery and fuel energy and induce stack degradation, and therefore should be scheduled as infrequently as possible. Simple models of the battery and SOFC are used to evaluate the optimal scheduling strategy using Dynamic Programming. Representative cycles are generated from random sampling of measured power data for specific tasks. Finally a rule-based control strategy is developed and compared with the optimal one, considering battery degradation, fuel efficiency as well as design robustness. The application to military tracked robots for surveillance is considered as an example using power profiles from an instrumented PackBot; however the methodology can be applied broadly to hybrid power systems for transportation which have large turn on/off penalties.},

abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries are prone to aging, which decreases the battery performance. The term battery State of Health (SOH) is widely used to describe many different aspects of battery performance. One critical aging characteristic is the loss of cyclable energy quantified by the decrease in capacity. Algorithms that estimate the capacity fade using voltage measurements are widely published in literature and are commonly used in commercial Battery Management Systems (BMS). However, there are fewer studies identifying the aging mechanisms, such as the loss of cyclable lithium, or the loss of active material, both of which manifest as capacity fade. Furthermore, many of these algorithms require voltage measurement data acquired during a full charge or discharge cycle, which is inconvenient to obtain while the battery is in use. In the following, we present a methodology to identify the aging mechanisms by changes in the capacity of active material in each electrode, and the changes in the stoichiometric operating window of the half-cell potentials. The proposed method utilizes measurement obtained from only two operating points, with no requirement on a constant current while traversing between these two operating points. The method is tested via simulating the LiFePO4 (LFP) chemistry, where identification is particularly difficult due to its flat voltage characteristics. Furthermore, unlike previously presented methods, the identifiability of the aging mechanisms is studied with respect to location of the two operating points in the voltage curve. It is important to note that the techniques explored and proposed in this paper rely on opportunistic measurements of terminal voltage after a rest period due to its reliance on the invariant characteristic of the half-cell potentials.},

abstract = {Automatic Train (or Tram) Operation (ATO) systems have been widely studied in the last decade to guarantee energy-efficient operation. Speed profiles and timetables are derived by applying optimization methods geared towards finding the optimal trade-off between journey time, emissions and energy efficiency. An on-board controller is required to track such optimal trajectories, despite model uncertainties. Due to the non-linear dynamics and non-holonomic constraints on both inputs and outputs, the tracking of such trajectories represents a difficult task. This paper deals with the design of the tracking algorithm, for a catenary-free tram, with regenerative braking. A Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach is used to track the optimal position profile. Thanks to the ability to easily deal with multivariable systems, make use of the references and disturbances preview, and enforce time-varying input/output constraints, MPC is the perfect candidate to fulfill this task. The proposed MPC formulation is simple enough to be implemented in real-time, with a quadratic programming solver. Results show that the algorithm tracks the position reference, and guarantees punctuality and comfort, while enforcing time-varying constraints on vehicle velocity, electrical machine and friction forces. The results are also confirmed in the case of operation with model mismatch.},

Internal short circuit (ISCr) is one of the major safety issues of lithium batteries and would lead to thermal runaway of batteries. Repeating ISCr in laboratory requires to create small-scale short circuit inside integrated batteries, which is very hard for existed safety test methods. In this paper, a novel ISCr trigger method based on shape memory effect of shape memory alloy (SMA) is proposed, which is easy to be implanted into batteries while has minor influences on batteries normal performance. The proposed SMA ISCr trigger method is employed to conduct ISCr experiments, including the severest type of ISCr, the Aluminum-Anode ISCr, and the most common type of ISCr, the Cathode-Anode ISCr. The experiments results show that the Aluminum-Anode ISCr leads to explosion while the Cathode-Anode ISCr only leads to mild self-discharging. Compared with the nail penetration test, the proposed SMA ISCr trigger method in the Aluminum-Anode ISCr experiment has 1) better consistency, given that all of the 4 tested batteries have their maximum temperature in the range of 383∼393 ◦ C; 2) better reliability in evaluating battery safety properties, given that all of the 4 tested batteries have the repeatable explosion behavior. The relative ease of inserting this controllable SMA ISCr and the repeatability of the produced data can lead to better modeling and detection techniques of battery internal shorts such as plating and dendrite formation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2017. Published by ECS. All rights reserved. Internal short circuit (ISCr) is one of the major reasons for lithium-ion battery thermal runaway. A new phenomenon, named as the Fusing Phenomenon, is observed during the ISCr experiments. During the Fusing Phenomenon, the ISCr current path will melt down due to the Joule heat of the short current and the ISCr process will be interrupted. The Fusing Phenomenon raises the re-ISCr problem, which means that the battery may have an ISCr again after the end of the former ISCr process. The Fusing Phenomenon's life cycle is given by the hypothesis, which includes the heating-melting period, the ion discharging period and the implosion period. The heating-melting period is analyzed using an axisymmetric local ISCr model. When the ISCr area radius increases, the ISCr current path melting position will change from the ISCr area to the ISCr area edge of the aluminum current collector. If the ISCr area radius is large enough, the battery will run into the thermal runaway instead of the Fusing Phenomenon. The influence factors of the Fusing Phenomenon, including the ISCr area radius and the ISCr material, are analyzed. This research provides new insights on the battery ISCr and enriches our understanding of the ISCr process.},

abstract = {Developing and parameterizing models that accurately predict the battery voltage and temperature in a vehicle battery pack are challenging due to the complex geometries of the airflow that influence the convective heat transfer. This paper addresses the difficulty in parameterizing low-order models which rely on coupling with finite element simulations. First, we propose a methodology to couple the parameterization of an equivalent circuit model (ECM) for both the electrical and thermal battery behavior with a finite element model (FEM) for the parameterization of the convective cooling of the airflow. In air-cooled battery packs with complex geometries and cooling channels, an FEM can provide the physics basis for the parameterization of the ECM that might have different convective coefficients between the cells depending on the airflow patterns. The second major contribution of this work includes validation of the ECM against the data collected from a three-cell fixture that emulates a segment of the pack with relevant cooling conditions for a hybrid vehicle. The validation is performed using an array of thin film temperature sensors covering the surface of the cell. Experiments with pulsing currents and drive cycles are used for validation over a wide range of operating conditions (ambient temperature, state of charge, current amplitude, and pulse width).},

abstract = {Traditionally, battery State of Charge (SOC) is estimated using measurements of current, temperature, and Terminal Voltage (TV). For some battery chemistry, such as Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP), the voltage is flat (low slope) making the rate of convergence of the SOC estimation relatively slow. In this case, measurement of the cell expansion caused by swelling of the electrode active material during charging can be used to augment the estimation scheme. In previous work [1] [2], the force (F) generated by cell swelling in a constrained package has an affine dependency on SOC. In this paper we consider the LFP chemistry with phase transition of the active electrode material resulting in non-unique F-SOC relation, hence requiring a novel estimator. The non-monotonic (F) could potentially drive any output based observer, like the Linear Quadratic Estimator (LQE), to an incorrect equilibrium. To address this problem, a piecewise-linear (PWL) model is used to approximate the F-SOC curve, which enables the automatic selection of the gain with the correct (positive or negative) slope. The comparison between the TV, F, and the fusion of both sensors is investigated via simulations of a nonlinear higher order model of the battery eletro-mechanical behavior. The electrical battery model is described by an equivalent circuit model and a nonlinear open circuit plus hysteresis model. The performance of the estimators based on the TV and F sensors are compared and evaluated against the ±5{\%} absolute error of the SOC using the Dynamic Stress Test (DST) protocol.},

It is proven that the optimal current policy is a sequence of constant voltage, constant current, and rest phases.

Conventional mechanically-driven superchargers or electric superchargers have been proposed to improve the dynamic response of boosted engines, but their projected fuel efficiency benefit depends heavily on the engine transient response and driver/cycle aggressiveness. The fuel consumption benefits depend on the closed loop engine responsiveness, the control tuning, and the torque reserve needed for its technology. To perform the drive cycle analysis, a control strategy is designed that minimizes the boost reserve and employs high rates of combustion dilution via exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). The fully dynamic drive cycle results are compared to steady state GT-Power projections, using residence-time spent in various steady state operating points. The fuel consumption benefits enabled by the hybrid supercharger are simulated for the three standard drive cycles, FTP75, HWFET, and US06 and various drivers' aggressiveness, showing a maximum of 5{\%} improvement.},

abstract = {Military vehicles are typically armored, hence the open surface area for heat rejection is limited. Hence, the cooling parasitic load for a given heat rejection can be considerably higher and important to consider upfront in the system design. Since PEMFCs operate at low temp, the required cooling flow is larger to account for the smaller delta temperature to the air. This research aims to address the combined problem of optimal sizing of the lithium ion battery and PEM Fuel Cell stack along with development of the scalable power split strategy for small a PackBot robot. We will apply scalable physics-based models of the fuel cell stack and balance of plant that includes a realistic and scalable parasitic load from cooling integrated with existing scalable models of the lithium ion battery. This model allows the combined optimization that captures the dominant trends relevant to component sizing and system performance. The baseline optimal performance is assessed using dynamic programming for a reduced order model, by assuming a static cooling load required to maintain the stack at the operating temperature with peak efficiency. Pseudo-spectral optimization methods, which enable fast computation even for larger number of states in the model is then used to consider the additional control of the cooling system. For scaling of the battery in the hybrid system we can use a modular approach, adding cells in parallel and series. If the fuel cell operates always with net power above the peak efficiency point, a simple rule based strategy can nearly recover the optimal fuel consumption achieved with dynamic programming. However, for stack operation at powers near and below the peak eff point the simple rule based strategy performs almost 20{\%} worse than the optimal.},

abstract = {A non-intuitive aspect of the transient management of a waste energy recovery (WER) system on a small turbocharged gasoline engine is presented in this work. The WER system is realized with a positive displacement expander and an electric motor, named exhaust turbo generating (ETG) system. The steady state simulations indicate that for a range of medium loads it can provide up to 5.5{\%} reduction in the fuel consumption. For this, the ETG system set point and the engine spark timing, which is affected by the extra imposed backpressure, are optimized offline. The decentralized control design presented in this work warrants effective actuator coordination including five controlling actuators on the engine level and two for the ETG system. A sliding mode controller is designed for controlling the ETG speed with different closed loop bandwidths. The results indicate that the optimum control strategy is not the one with the fastest closed loop ETG response. Specifically, one would expect that the fastest transients would be better in maintaining the benefits that were projected in steady state GT-Power simulations. With this work, it is clarified for the first time that the ETG control design tuned to optimize the transitions to optimal rotational speed is as important as the actual selection of these steady state optimal set points, which has been studied extensively in the past.},

Electrode SOH can be quantified based on estimating the capacity and the utilization range of each electrode. Here, we introduce two methods: i) voltage fitting (VF) and ii) peak alignment (PA), and compare their ability to estimate the electrode SOH parameters. Both methods assume the half-cell open-circuit potentials (OCPs) are invariant functions of the stoichiometric states with the cell aging, which can make the accuracy of the electrode parameter estimation vulnerable to degradation that would cause changes in the half-cell OCP curves. This hypothesis is verified experimentally by applying the two methods to aged cells cycled at high temperature. A discernible misalignment of the peaks is observed in the differential voltage curve from the VF method indicating the estimation result is incorrect, even though it reconstructs the OCV with the small error and estimates the cell capacity accurately. Therefore, it is seen that the lower voltage error and the accurate cell capacity estimate do not necessarily promise a better estimation accuracy for the electrode SOH parameters.},

For this reason, identifying each electrode's capacity and utilization window is important for the safe operation of the battery, unfortunately the standard capacity estimation method cannot provide this. In this work, we introduce electrode-specific State of Health (eSOH) related parameters, including individual electrode capacity and utilization window. We explore the identifiability of the parameters using terminal voltage alone and voltage plus cell expansion measurements. The analysis here is based on the constrained Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) formulation, which provides the error bounds for the parameters. The model utilizes the voltage/expansion functions of lithium stoichiometry for the individual electrodes based on the underlying physics of phase transitions. It is shown that slope changes in voltage and expansion that correspond to phase transitions in the electrodes enhance the estimation. As a result, with the addition of the expansion, the parameters are estimable without the need to discharge the battery to a high Depth of Discharge ({\textgreater}70{\%}), which rarely happens in automotive applications. This makes eSOH estimation feasible for a wider range of real-world driving scenarios.},

The measured dead Li thickness is used as an input to the model, and both the effective diffusion coefficient and ionic conductivity of the dead Li layer have been tuned to match the terminal voltage response of a Li-NMC 532 coin cell under galvanostatic cycling. The model captures the changes in terminal voltage and apparent cell capacity as the dead Li layer builds up. This model can be inverted to estimate the thickness and effective transport properties of the dead Li layer from the observed terminal voltage for enhanced diagnostics of the apparent capacity degradation of Li metal battery cells as well as fast-charging Li ion battery systems with graphite anodes.},

abstract = {Low voltage hybridization ({\textless}60 V) supports engine start/stop, regenerative braking, and constrained torque assist/regeneration at a low cost. This work studies the potential benefits of a novel hybrid system, called a power split supercharger (PSS). A 9 kW motor is shared between boosting the engine or providing hybrid functionalities, allowing it to couple with a small engine and still support good acceleration. However, the PSS operation is limited to only one of the parallel hybrid or boosting modes at each time instance. In this work an equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) is developed to select the PSS mode and the motor torque during hybrid mode. The PSS operation is simulated over standard EPA drive cycles with an engine mean value model that captures detailed air path and PSS dynamics. The results show that on the combined cycle the PSS improves the vehicle fuel economy by around 20{\%} compared to a vehicle with a turbocharged engine, which is more than 90{\%} of the fuel economy improvement previously predicted through a dynamic programming global fuel economy optimization.},

abstract = {This study provides a comparison of a linear and unscented Kalman filter to estimate the dynamics of a two-stroke opposed piston engine. These engines maintain several advantages over conventional internal combustion engines including reduced heat transfer, higher power to weight ratio, and a larger expansion ratio. Additionally, a crank angle phasing is introduced between the two cranks to improve scavenging efficiency. However, the coupling of the two crankshafts through a large geartrain can cause high amounts of noise and vibration harshness (NVH) and mechanical efficiency losses. By removing the geartrain and controlling the decoupled crankshafts with motor-generators, the NVH can be minimized while maintaining the benefits of crank angle phasing. To control the input torque of the motors to the engine, accurate estimations of the crankshaft position and dynamics are necessary. While the unscented Kalman filter exhibits lower estimation error, the filter is sensitive to model uncertainty relating to cylinder pressure, demanding further investigation of the robustness of the nonlinear filter.},

Managing the potent brew of lithium-ion batteries in the large quantities necessary for vehicle propulsion is still challenging. From space applications a billion miles from Earth to the daily commute of a hybrid electric automobile, these batteries require sophisticated battery management systems based on accurate estimation of battery internal states. This system is the brain of the battery and is responsible for estimating the state of charge, state of health, state of power, and temperature. The state estimation relies on accurate prediction of complex electrochemical, thermal, and mechanical phenomena, which increases the importance of model and parameter accuracy. Moreover, as the batteries age, how should the parameters of the model change to accurately represent the performance, and how can we leverage the limited sensor information from the measured terminal voltage and sparse surface temperatures available in a battery system? With a frugal sensor set, what is the optimal sensor placement? This article reviews estimation techniques and error bounds regarding sensor noise and modeling errors, and concludes with an outlook on the research that will be necessary to enable fast charging, repurposing of batteries for grid energy storage, degradation prediction, and fault detection.},

abstract = {Recent data-driven approaches have shown great potential in early prediction of battery cycle life by utilizing features from the discharge voltage curve. However, these studies caution that data-driven approaches must be combined with specific design of experiments in order to limit the range of aging conditions, since the expected life of Li-ion batteries is a complex function of various aging factors. In this work, we investigate the performance of the data-driven approach for battery lifetime prognostics with Li-ion batteries cycled under a variety of aging conditions, in order to determine when the data-driven approach can successfully be applied. Results show a correlation between the variance of the discharge capacity difference and the end-of-life for cells aged under a wide range of charge/discharge C-rates and operating temperatures. This holds despite the different conditions being used not only to cycle the batteries but also to obtain the features: the features are calculated directly from cycling data without separate slow characterization cycles at a controlled temperature. However, the correlation weakens considerably when the voltage data window for feature extraction is reduced, or when features from the charge voltage curve instead of discharge are used. As deep constant-current discharges rarely happen in practice, this imposes new challenges for applying this method in a real-world system.},

abstract = {Differential voltage analysis (DVA) is a conventional approach for estimating capacity degradation in batteries. During charging, a graphite electrode goes through several phase transitions observed as plateaus in the voltage response. The transitions between these plateaus emerge as observable peaks in the differential voltage. The DVA method utilizes these peaks for estimating cell degradation. Unfortunately, at higher C-rates (above C/2) the peaks flatten and become unobservable. In this work, we show that, unlike the differential voltage, the peaks in the 2nd derivative of the expansion with respect to capacity remain observable up to 1C and thus make possible diagnostic algorithms at these charging rates. To understand why that is the case, we have developed an electrochemical and expansion model suitable for model-based estimation. In particular, we demonstrate that the single particle modeling methodology is not able to capture the peak smoothing effect, therefore a multi-particle approach for the graphite electrode is needed. Additionally, model parameters are identified using experimental data from a graphite/NMC pouch cell. The proposed model produces an excellent fit for the observed electric and mechanical swelling response of the cells and could enable physics-based data-driven degradation studies at practical charging rates.},

abstract = {Thermal management is a critical task of battery control to ensure the safe, efficient, and enduring performance of the battery system, which can be considered as an interconnected thermal network of cells. The basis of thermal management is the estimation of temperature and its gradient across the battery system, which has received extensive attention in the literature. However, existing works neglect two important constraints in practical battery systems: 1) limited number of available sensors and 2) presence of system uncertainty such as parameter error. This paper is the first to investigate robust battery system temperature estimation under sparse sensing and system uncertainty. We first propose a framework consisting of optimization problems at three different levels: 1) evaluation of the worst case estimation performance (error) under uncertainty; 2) robust observer design to minimize the worst case error; and 3) optimization of sensor locations. Two robust estimation methods are then used to solve the problem. The system uncertainty considered in this paper is the unknown resistance variability among battery cells, but the methodology can be applied to address other types of uncertainty. It is shown that the designed observers could guarantee and improve the robustness and reliability of estimation by significantly reducing the worst case estimation errors induced by uncertainty.},

abstract = {A novel hybrid system enabling both flexible supercharging and limited torque assist is studied to mitigate transient response challenges of a turbocharged spark ignition engine equipped with low pressure exhaust gas recirculation. The hybrid system, called a power split supercharger (SC), is configured with a planetary gear set that splits the supercharging power between a small low-voltage electric motor and the engine crankshaft. The air path controller relies on the coordination of four actuators on the engine side and three low-level actuators on the hybrid boosting device. A decentralized control scheme is used in this work, in which the master–slave structure of the boost pressure controller decreases the turbo-lag associated with exhaust gas recirculation, while minimizing the SC operation for fuel economy. A vector reference governor is used to prevent compressor surge during engine tip-outs. In addition, the desired intake manifold pressure is modified to provide time for evacuating the exhaust gas recirculation and avoiding misfires when transitioning to low load, while the hybrid capability of the power split SC is used to recuperate the unwanted generated power. All controllers are validated on both a mean value engine model and a high-fidelity engine model. Practical challenges of implementing the vector reference governor to the highly nonlinear engine air path with pressure pulsations originating from the engine reciprocation are discussed and some solutions are proposed.},

abstract = {Li-ion battery internal short circuits are a major safety issue for electric vehicles, and can lead to serious consequences such as battery thermal runaway. An internal short can be caused by mechanical abuse, high temperature, overcharging, and lithium plating. The low impedance or hard internal short circuit is the most dangerous kind. The high internal current flow can lead to battery temperature increase, thermal runaway, and even explosion in a few seconds. Algorithms that can quickly detect such serious events with a high confidence level and which are robust to sensor noise are needed to ensure passenger safety. False positives are also undesirable as many thermal runaway mitigation techniques, such as activating pyrotechnic safety switches, would disable the vehicle. Conventional methods of battery internal short detection, including voltage and surface temperature based algorithms, work well for a single cell. However, these methods are difficult to apply in large scale battery packs with many parallel cells. In this study, we propose a new internal short detection method by using cell swelling information during the early stages of a battery heating caused by an internal short circuit. By measuring cell expansion force, higher confidence level detection can be achieved for an internal short circuit in an electric vehicle scale battery pack.},

abstract = {This work investigates an innovative low-voltage ({\textless}60 V) hybrid device that enables engine boosting and downsizing in addition to mild hybrid functionalities such as regenerative braking, start-stop, and torque assist. A planetary gear set and a brake permit the power split supercharger (PSS) to share a 9 kW motor between supercharging the engine and direct torque supply to the crankshaft. In contrast, most e-boosting schemes use two separate motors for these two functionalities. This single motor structure restricts the PSS operation to only one of the supercharging or parallel hybrid modes; therefore, an optimized decision making strategy is necessary to select both the device mode and its power split ratio. An adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy (A-ECMS), which uses the battery state of charge (SoC) history to adjust the equivalence factor, is developed for energy management of the PSS. The A-ECMS effectiveness is compared against a dynamic programming (DP) solution with full drive cycle preview through hardware-in-the-loop experiments on an engine dynamometer testbed. The experiments show that the PSS with A-ECMS reduces vehicle fuel consumption by 18.4{\%} over standard FTP75 cycle, compared to a baseline turbocharged engine, while global optimal DP solution decreases the fuel consumption by 22.8{\%} compared to the baseline.},

abstract = {Measurements such as current and terminal voltage that are typically used to determine the battery's state of charge (SOC) are augmented with measured force associated with electrode expansion as the lithium intercalates in its structure. The combination of the sensed behavior is shown to improve SOC estimation even for the lithium ion iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry, where the voltage-SOC relation is flat (low slope) making SOC estimation using measured voltage difficult. For the LFP cells, the measured force has a non-monotonic F-SOC relationship. This presents a challenge for estimation as multiple force values can correspond to the same SOC. The traditional linear quadratic estimator can be driven to an incorrect SOC value. To address these difficulties, a novel switching estimation gain is used based on determining the operating region that corresponds to the actual SOC. Moreover, a drift in the measured force associated with a shift of the cell SOC-expansion behavior over time is addressed with a bias estimator for the force signal. The performance of Voltage-based (V) and Voltage and Force-based (V{\&}F) SOC estimation algorithms are then compared and evaluated against a desired ±5{\%} absolute error bound of the SOC using a dynamic stress test current protocol that tests the proposed estimation scheme across wide range of SOC and current rates.},

abstract = {Li-ion battery thermal runaway is a critical safety issue for Electric Vehicles. The proposed global technical regulation No. 20 by the United Nations on Electric Vehicle Safety requires an advanced warning 5 minutes prior to the evolution of hazardous conditions caused by thermal runaway. To achieve this 5-min advanced warning, a robust and sensitive detection methodology is required. Gas venting is often a precursor of thermal runaway, and therefore the use of gas-based detection method was evaluated in this paper to explore its response and implementation within a battery pack. The composition of battery vent-gas during a thermal runaway event includes CO2, CO, H2 and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Among these gas species, there is still some debate about which is most suitable for detection. To resolve this debate, the composition of vent-gas under different testing conditions is summarized from the literature and CO2 is proposed as the target gas species due to its significant presence and early occurrence in all venting events. After evaluating available sensors, the Non-Dispersive Infrared (NDIR) CO2 sensor is considered due to its robustness and cost effectiveness. To further clarify the responsiveness of the NDIR CO2 sensor, an overcharging experiment leading to cell venting was conducted with a prototype gas sensor suite. The measured CO2 concentrations of over 30,000 ppm were detected with the gas sensor. Lastly, we demonstrate how a representative venting experiment of a single cell can be used to guide and set the sensed CO2 threshold that will trigger an alarm in a battery pack volume.},
